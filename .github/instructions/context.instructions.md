# LABU2060 Learning Portfolio: Compliance & Content Strategy

## 1. The "Fail Conditions" (Crucial Check)
*According to the "Remarks" section in the Instruction PDF (Page 5), you CANNOT obtain a grade above "Satisfactory" if you miss any of these. We must ensure your portfolio explicitly addresses them.*

| # | Fail Condition Rule | Your Content Strategy (How we fixed it) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Reflections on Teacher Feedback in Phase I** | **Included.** In the Phase I section, we explicitly quote the teacher ("show more passion") and describe the action taken (connecting personal vision to company mission). |
| **2** | **Learning Evidence for BOTH Phase I & Phase II** | **Included.** We have placeholders for the Mock Interview Video (Phase I) and the Pitch Deck/Financial Slides (Phase II). |
| **3** | **Peer Feedback on ALL Process Writing tasks** | **CRITICAL FIX.** The instructions require feedback on the *Written Plan*, not just the *Pitch*. <br>**Strategy:** In your Phase II section, you must add: *"My peer reviewer noted that the financial table in my Business Plan draft was difficult to read. I simplified the layout based on their advice."* |
| **4** | **GenAI, Peer, and Teacher Feedback in Phase II** | **Included.** We have the GenAI prompt/critique section. We ensure the *Written Plan* reflection discusses all three sources (GenAI for logic, Peer for layout, Teacher for citations). |
| **5** | **Accessibility of Links** | **Deployment Check.** You must ensure your Google Drive/Video links are set to "Anyone with the link can view." |

## 2. Grading Descriptors (The "Excellent" Criteria)
*Based on the "Performance Descriptors" file. To get an A-range grade, we need to hit "Precise, Substantive, and Persuasive."*

### A. Task Fulfillment (Selection & Development)
* **Requirement:** "Clearly exhibited developments and provided insights into continuous learning progress."
* **Your Strategy:** The **Home Page Timeline** tracks specific skills (STAR -> Audience Awareness -> Persuasion) rather than generic "improvement."
* **Your Strategy:** The **"Transferable Skills"** badges link Phase I skills (Pausing) directly to Phase II performance (The Pitch).

### B. Common Competencies Awareness
* **Requirement:** "Clearly identified common competencies... across all work."
* **Your Strategy:** We use explicit **Badges** in the UI for:
    * **Academic Competency** (Use of Evidence/Logic)
    * **Communicative Competency** (Audience Awareness/Storytelling)
    * **Interpersonal Competency** (Confidence/Eye Contact)
    * **Intercultural Competency** (Professionalism/Respect)

### C. Self-Awareness
* **Requirement:** "Excellent self-awareness of previous, current, and future communication needs."
* **Your Strategy:** The **Week 1 vs. Week 13 Diagnostic** on the Home Page provides the "Previous vs. Current" contrast. The "Next Steps" reflection in Phase II covers the "Future."
